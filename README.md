# Numerical Methods & Mathematical Applications

This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental numerical analysis methods, developed as part of my Software Engineering studies at Ben-Gurion University.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Interpolation & Data Modeling (Work 3)
* **Goal**: Approximating data points and creating smooth curves.
* **Methods**: Implementation of **Cubic Splines** and **Lagrange Polynomials**.
* **Tools**: Developed using **NumPy** for vector calculations and **Matplotlib** for visualization.

### 2. Function Approximation & Integration (Work 4)
* **Goal**: Approximating complex non-linear functions and calculating definite integrals.
* **Methods**: Implementation of **Taylor Series**, **Legendre Polynomials**, and the **Trapezoidal Rule**.
* **Logic**: Utilized recursive functions for degree-n polynomial evaluations.

## Technologies Used
* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Matplotlib (for data visualization)
* Math library (built-in)

## How to Use
Each script is standalone and can be executed to see the mathematical approximations in action.
